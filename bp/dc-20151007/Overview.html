<section id="outline"><h2>Outline</h2>
<p>This best practice sets out a number of criteria that can be used to prioritise the publication of some datasets ahead of others.</p>
</section>


<section id="ms"><h2>Management Summary</h2>

<section id="challenge"><h3>Challenge</h3>
<p>To develop the criteria for ‘high-value datasets’ taking into consideration the likely re-use of open data and to help governments understand which datasets to prioritise for publication.</p>
</section>

<section id="solution"><h3>Solution</h3>
<p>To follow this guidance on dataset criteria which has been developed through engaging with both users and re-users of the data. The characteristics of ‘high-value datasets’ are seen from three perspectives: re-usabiity, value for data owners, value for re-users.</p>
<h4 id="reusability">Re-usability</h4>
<ul><li>High-value data should reach at least 3-stars on Tim Berners-Lee's <a href="/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html">5 star schema</a> (making it available on the Web under an open license in a non-proprietary, structured format).</li></ul>

<h4 id="owner">Value for data owner</h4>
<p>A dataset may be considered of high-value when one or more of the following criteria are met:</p><ul>
<li>sharing it contributes to transparency;</li>
<li>the publication is subject to a legal obligation;</li>
<li>the data directly or indirectly relates to their public task;</li>
<li>sharing it helps with cost reduction.</li></ul>

<h4 id="reusers">Value for re-users</h4>
<p>The value of a dataset primarily depends on its use and re-use potential, which can lead to the generation of business activity. The potential of the dataset is defined by:</p><ul>
<li>the size and dynamics of the target audience;</li>
<li>the number of systems or services that could use the dataset.</li></ul>
<p>Datasets contributing to transparency have a strong social impact and re-user’s interest in these datasets is high.</p>

<h4 id="engage">Engaging with Reusers</h4>
<p>It is important to engage directly with re-users to understand the value of your dataset. Recommendations:</p><ul>
<li>establish a communication channel, for example, with a mailing list or a community on <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/">Joinup</a> or on the Open Data Portal that could be used to make announcements to re-users and to gather feedback;</li>
<li>use collaborative tools. This encourages collaboration between a community or re-users and the cross-fertilisation of ideas and business opportunities.</li></ul>

<section id="bpi"><h2>Best Practice Identification</h2>
<section id="why"><h3>Why is this a Best Practice? What’s the impact of the Best Practice</h3>
<p>It’s important to have a shared understanding of what can be considered to be high-value datasets so that publication of these datasets can be prioritised.</p>
</section>

<section id="links"><h3>Links to the Revised PSI Directive</h3><p><a href="/2013/share-psi/elements#criteria">Dataset criteria</a></p></section>

<section id="whyNeed"><h3>Why is there a need for this Best Practice?</h3>
<p>Understanding which datasets should be published, under what criteria and priority, will help public authorities to see the benefits of publishing more high quality datasets.</p>
</section>

<section id="whatNeed"><h3>What do you need for this Best Practice?</h3>
<p>An understanding of high-value data, and communication channels with data users and data reusers.</p>
