<section id="outline"><h2>Outline</h2>
<p>Datasets that are fit for publication as Open Data need to be identified as well as the requirements of both the internal and external stakeholders. Open Data publication plan should be developed taking into account needs of the relevant stakeholders as well as the potential benefits, risks and costs of publication of the datasets.</p>
</section>


<section id="ms"><h2>Management Summary</h2>

<section id="challenge"><h3>Challenge</h3>
<p>Public sector bodies hold a large number of various datasets. However they also operate under budgetary and various other constraints that prevent them from making every potential dataset available for re-use at once. Beside this the complete list of datasets is not always available which complicates identification and selection of datasets to be published as Open Data.</p>
</section>

<section id="solution"><h3>Solution</h3>
<p>An analysis of the available datasets should be performed, needs and requirements of both the internal and external stakeholders should be understood and the Open Data publication plan should be developed. Publication of Open Data should be in line with the strategic aims of the organization, with the relevant policies such as the national Open Data strategy and it should meet the demand of the potential users of the data. Therefore the requirements both internal and external stakeholders should be identified and analyzed. Based on the results of the previous steps the Open Data publication plan should be developed. It should contain all the necessary tasks to implement the Open Data initiative. With regard to the datasets planned to be published as Open Data a release roadmap should be developed. Release of the datasets should be prioritized taking into consideration the requirements of the stakeholders as well as the results of the analysis of the datasets, i.e. the identified benefits and risks and the cost/effort estimates. Progress should tracked against the Open Data publication plan. This plan should be also regularly reviewed and updated.</p>

<section id="bpi"><h2>Best Practice Identification</h2>
<section id="why"><h3>Why is this a Best Practice? What’s the impact of the Best Practice</h3>
<p>The use of an Open Data publication plan has been successfully applied by many Governments. Developing and implementing a publication plan which takes into account needs of the relevant stakeholders as well as the potential benefits, risks and costs of publication of the datasets can help public sector bodies publish their datasets.</p>

<section id="whyNeed"><h3>Why is there a need for this Best Practice?</h3>
<p>This best practice aims at balancing the requirements and needs of the relevant stakeholders with the available resources by planning of the data release and other necessary steps that takes into account the demand for data, the potential benefits and risks associated with the publication of the identified datasets as well as the estimated costs of the publication.</p>
</section>

<section id="whatNeed"><h3>What do you need for this Best Practice?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Obtaining a top management support.</li>
  <li>Appointing a person responsible for development of the Open Data publication plan.</li>
  <li>Securing cooperation of the departments involved in the Open Data initiative.</li>
  <li>Setting up a review process for the Open Data publication plan.</li></ul>
</section></section>

<section id="applicability"><h2>Applicability by other Member States</h2>
<p>The approach is applicable to any Member State. However the legal framework, national or other strategies as well as for example the data management practices applied in the particular member state and its public sector bodies might affect what datasets should be included in the Open Data publication plan and how this plan is going to be implemented and assessed.</p>
